# Day of the Week Calculator

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a Python program that determines the day of the week for a given date. This application falls under Date & Time applications and is useful in calendar-based systems.

## Approach Used
The program uses Python’s built-in `datetime` module to convert the user-entered date into a date object. The corresponding day of the week is extracted and displayed using a menu-driven approach. Exception handling is used to manage invalid inputs.

## Features
- Menu-driven console application
- Calculates day of the week for any valid date
- Displays today's day
- Handles invalid date formats
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Sample Input
15-08-2025

## Sample Output
Day of the week: Friday

## Challenges Faced
Handling incorrect date formats was resolved using exception handling in Python.
